/*! \brief Implementation to observe the solution without updating state
 *         information.
 *
 * When LOCA completes solve(), a number of things happen, some with side
 * effects: eigendata are computed and saved, response functions are evaluated,
 * and printSolution is called. Previously, ObserverImpl called
 * updateStates. This meant that it could only be called after the RFs were
 * evaluated. Moreover, if eigedata were saved, the state field manager would be
 * evaluated with the eigenvectors as solutions, which gives meaningless results
 * for the _new states, and then updateStates would copy that meaningless data
 * from _new to _old.
 *
 * This class is at least part of a solution to this problem. Eigendata are now
 * saved using this stateless observer impl, so updateStates is not called. The
 * order in LOCA at present follows:
 *     solve;
 *     postProcessContinuationStep: eval RF;
 *     printSolution: eval sfm, updateStates, write to exo file.
 * Problems remain in how LOCA::AdaptiveStepper and Albany interact, but I think
 * LOCA::Stepper and Albany may be entirely OK now in terms of sequencing and
 * updating state.
 *
 * It probably would have been a better design to make a StatefulObserver
 * subclassed from an (assumed, as NOX/LOCA do) stateless one. However, that
 * would change the name of a class already in wide use, which I don't want to
 * do. Instead, NOXStatelessObserver will start with just one user and
 * NOXObserver will continue to behave as it always has.
